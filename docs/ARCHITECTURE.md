# Social Hub architecture

Modular monolith + workers. One Postgres database. Platform logic lives in social adapters, not in business services.

## Domain model

```
User → Workspace → Social Accounts
                 → Leads → Social Profiles
                 → Lead Account Relationships
                 → Lead Interactions
                 → Campaigns → Campaign Leads / Campaign Accounts
                 → Posts → Post Targets
                 → Monitoring Rules → Monitoring Events
                 → Jobs
```

One workspace has many social accounts. Never assume 1 platform = 1 account.

## Independent state machines

| Machine | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `LeadStatus` | CRM stage of a person |
| `ContactStatus` | State of one (lead, profile, our account) relationship |
| `CampaignStatus` | Campaign lifecycle |
| `JobStatus` | Queue item |
| `SocialAccountStatus` | Connected account health |

`do_not_contact` exists only on `leads`. It is not a contact status.

## Request path

UI → Route / Server Action → Domain Service → Social Adapter → Platform API or TinyFish (server-side only)

Tokens, API keys, and session cookies never go to the client.

## Social adapters (PHASE 2)

`getSocialAdapter(platform)` is the only place that maps a platform to an implementation. Services must not branch on `platform === "telegram"` (or any other platform).

PHASE 2 capabilities are all disabled. `collect`, `publish`, `monitor`, and `executeContactAction` throw `UnsupportedActionError` instead of returning fake success.

Encrypted access and refresh tokens are omitted from authenticated `SELECT` on `social_accounts`. Owners and admins read them through `read_social_account_secrets`.
